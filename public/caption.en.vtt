00:00:16.891 --> 00:00:17.976
For this skill,

2
00:00:17.976 --> 00:00:21.396
you will need a gait belt,
a pair of shoes, a chair

3
00:00:21.813 --> 00:00:24.065
gloves and hand sanitizer.

4
00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:26.943
Be familiar with the residents care plan.

5
00:00:26.943 --> 00:00:31.156
Knock on the door, greet the resident,
addressing them by their preferred name.

6
00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:33.366
And introduce yourself.

7
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:37.579
Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer
and don gloves.

8
00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:39.456
Explain to the resident

9
00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:42.459
that you will be assisting them
to ambulate using a gait belt.

10
00:00:43.334 --> 00:00:47.047
Check that the resident is wearing
proper non-skid footwear and ask

11
00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:50.759
if they have any injuries or sensitivities
that you need to be aware of.

12
00:00:52.177 --> 00:00:56.056
Slide the gait belt under the residents
arm around the back of their waist

13
00:00:56.347 --> 00:01:00.185
and under the other arm to the front

14
00:01:00.852 --> 00:01:02.771
Secure the gait belt in the front

15
00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:06.149
so that only your fingers
and flat palm fit under the belt.

16
00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:08.026
Check the

17
00:01:08.026 --> 00:01:11.863
belt to ensure that it is over
the clothes and does not catch skin

18
00:01:11.863 --> 00:01:15.784
or skin folds and that the buckle
is not uncomfortable for the resident.

19
00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.579
Discuss a cue with the resident
to assist them to stand such

20
00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:20.830
as counting to three.

21
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.626
Bend your knees, stagger your feet,
bend at the waist and keep your back

22
00:01:24.626 --> 00:01:28.296
straight to maintain proper body alignment
to protect your back.

23
00:01:28.505 --> 00:01:30.590
Holding the belt on each side.

24
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.426
Count to three
and assist the resident to stand.

25
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.429
Check in with how the resident feels upon
standing.

26
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.975
Ask if they have any lightheadedness
dizziness or weakness.

27
00:01:42.185 --> 00:01:44.354
Slide
your hand around the back of the gait belt

28
00:01:44.562 --> 00:01:47.982
maintaining contact
and stand to the side of the resident

29
00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:50.568
and slightly behind them

30
00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:52.904
while supporting the gate belt.

31
00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:54.823
Begin to ambulate with the resident.

32
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.284
Ask how the resident

33
00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:01.329
feels during ambulation.

34
00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:03.706
Walk the resident at least ten steps.

35
00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:08.837
Sliding your hands back
around to the sides of the belt, position

36
00:02:08.837 --> 00:02:11.923
the resident in front of the chair.
Ask the patient

37
00:02:11.923 --> 00:02:15.135
to back up until they feel the chair
behind their knees.

38
00:02:15.677 --> 00:02:18.304
Instruct
the patient to reach for the armrests

39
00:02:18.304 --> 00:02:22.058
and sit their hips back into the chair
using proper body mechanics.

40
00:02:22.183 --> 00:02:24.686
Assist them back into the chair.

41
00:02:24.686 --> 00:02:26.729
Check the patient's
positioning in the chair.

42
00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:30.233
Ensure that their hips
are all the way back against the seat.

43
00:02:31.693 --> 00:02:35.238
Unfasten the gait belt and gently
remove it from behind the patient.

44
00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:39.367
Ensure you are not dragging the belt
across the patient as this can cause

45
00:02:39.367 --> 00:02:40.660
skin tears.

46
00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:44.289
Ask the patient if they are comfortable
and provide them with their call light.

47
00:02:46.207 --> 00:02:47.959
Remove your gloves

48
00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.086
and wash your hands.

49
00:02:51.254 --> 00:02:54.048
Here are a few things to keep in mind
when providing care.

50
00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:57.177
Always ask the resident
about their preferences.

51
00:02:57.218 --> 00:03:00.221
Use standard precautions and infection
control measures.

52
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.226
Ask the resident about comfort or needs
during care and before care is completed,

53
00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:09.022
and always promote the residents rights
and safety during care.
